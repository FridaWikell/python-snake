## User Experience

### User Stories

#### User Goals

The goal is to make the user have a good time. Maybe experience a flashback or two back until when your biggest entertainment was to play Snake at a Nokia 3310. The goal is also to get the user to challenge itself to beat its score.

#### Site Owner Goals

THe site owners goal is to provide an easy and fun place in the high technology enviroment with anvanced graphic we live in. 

## Design

### Color Scheme

The white background makes the black terminal pop out. The high contrast it's providing makes it easier to see and play the game without getting distracted.

The color at the snake is chosen to be eye-catching and pop out from the text. The colors in the button are chosen to be more neutral than the snake, since you need to look at the bottom when you are playing the game. They are green to bond to the green snake.

### Typography

The font in the terminal is not changed, to give the true retro feeling. The font in the buttom is chosen to make it easy to read.

### Imagery

The keyboard is chosen to be neutral but at the same enhance the retro feeling for the user. The retro feeling is even more enhanced thanks to it being and old Atari keyboard.

### Wireframes

## Features

### Feature title
Screenshot of implemented feature
Description of the value this feature has for the users

Repeat for each feature

## Features to be Added
Describe some additional features you could potentially add to the project that would increase user value - could be things linked to technologies not yet covered by the course but would be a benefit to the user for example, the ability to save an article, or add an article to the site, leave a review.


## Testing

### Validation of Code

![Screenshot of validation of HTML, without errors]()

The validation of the HTML code at [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) resulted without errors.


### Lighthouse
You can perform a test of your website for performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO through the google chrome lighthouse test - it is in your Dev tools. Bear in mind that your internet connection speed plays a part in the performance figures obtained. Where it scores low, it will give you suggestions on how to improve the site - read the suggestions and think about how to implement them - it could be a good idea.
Do this for both Desktop and Mobile.

### Wave Webaim
You can test your site for accessibility through the wave.webaim site - it needs to be deployed in order for it to test it. Fix any errors that it gives

### Manual Testing

You need to perform, and document everything you did to manually test your site.
At a minimum - you need to check every link on every page works as intended.
So that is check every link in the nav bar (do this on every single page because its a link in a different file) and any other links that appear on your site.
Test the responsiveness of the site - you can do this in the dev tools in responsive mode.
You should also load the site once deployed on as many devices you have access to. What is different from one device to the next? why is it different?

Test the user stories that you created earlier in the readme - did you satisfy the goal, how?

To write up the tests you can use a table,
| Feature being tested | Expected Outcome | Testing Performed | Actual Outcome | Result (Pass or fail) |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | enter details here |

You should have tests for every section of every page.. individually.

## Technologies Used

Detail what technologies you used. So what code languages, what frameworks, libraries, what software did you use to develop the site - Balsamic for your wireframes, Figma for a mockup?

## Deployment

Detail how to clone the repository, how to fork the repository - how to run the site locally and how to deploy it.


## Credits

You need to credit where you got anything for your site from.. where are the images from, are they all from the same site? where did you get the content from, if you wrote it yourself, did you fact check anywhere? did you get code from anywhere? if so, it needs to be clearly marked in both the code and the readme.
